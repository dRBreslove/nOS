# TEST.md

This document outlines the testing strategy and procedures for this project.

## Unit Tests

* **Purpose:** To verify the functionality of individual components and functions.
* **Framework:** [Specify your unit testing framework, e.g., Jest, Mocha, Jasmine].
* **Location:** Unit tests are located in the `__tests__` directory, or alongside the source files with a `.test.js` or `.spec.js` extension.
* **Naming Convention:** Test files should mirror the naming convention of the source files they test, with a `.test.js` or `.spec.js` suffix.
* **Coverage:** Aim for [Specify your target code coverage percentage, e.g., 80%, 90%] code coverage.
* **Execution:**
    * To run unit tests, use the following command: `npm test` or `yarn test` [Adjust command based on your project setup].
    * To run tests with coverage reporting, use: `npm test -- --coverage` or `yarn test --coverage`.
* **Example Test Structure (using Jest):**

    ```javascript
    // __tests__/example.test.js
    const exampleFunction = require('../example');

    describe('exampleFunction', () => {
      it('should return the correct result', () => {
        expect(exampleFunction(1, 2)).toBe(3);
      });

      it('should handle edge cases', () => {
        expect(exampleFunction(0, 0)).toBe(0);
      });

      it('should throw an error for invalid input', () => {
        expect(() => exampleFunction('a', 2)).toThrow();
      });
    });
    ```

## Integration Tests

* **Purpose:** To verify the interaction between different modules or services.
* **Framework:** [Specify your integration testing framework, e.g., Supertest, Cypress, Playwright].
* **Location:** Integration tests are located in the `integration-tests` directory.
* **Execution:**
    * To run integration tests, use the following command: `npm run test:integration` or `yarn test:integration` [Adjust command based on your project setup].
* **Example Integration Test (using Supertest with Express):**

    ```javascript
    // integration-tests/api.test.js
    const request = require('supertest');
    const app = require('../app'); // Your Express app

    describe('API Endpoints', () => {
      it('should return 200 OK for /api/users', async () => {
        const response = await request(app).get('/api/users');
        expect(response.status).toBe(200);
      });

      it('should return JSON data for /api/users', async () => {
        const response = await request(app).get('/api/users');
        expect(response.type).toBe('application/json');
      });
    });
    ```

## End-to-End (E2E) Tests

* **Purpose:** To simulate real user scenarios and ensure the application works as expected from the user's perspective.
* **Framework:** [Specify your E2E testing framework, e.g., Cypress, Playwright, Selenium].
* **Location:** E2E tests are located in the `e2e-tests` directory.
* **Execution:**
    * To run E2E tests, use the following command: `npm run test:e2e` or `yarn test:e2e` [Adjust command based on your project setup].
* **Example E2E Test (using Cypress):**

    ```javascript
    // e2e-tests/login.spec.js
    describe('Login Functionality', () => {
      it('should allow a user to log in successfully', () => {
        cy.visit('/login');
        cy.get('input[name="username"]').type('testuser');
        cy.get('input[name="password"]').type('password123');
        cy.get('button[type="submit"]').click();
        cy.url().should('include', '/dashboard');
        cy.contains('Welcome, testuser').should('be.visible');
      });
    });
    ```

## Manual Testing

* **Purpose:** To perform exploratory testing and identify issues that automated tests might miss.
* **Procedures:**
    * [Outline specific manual testing procedures, e.g., smoke tests, regression tests, usability tests].
    * [Document any specific test cases or checklists].
* **Reporting:**
    * Report any identified issues in the project's issue tracker.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

* **Integration:** Testing is integrated into the CI pipeline.
* **Tools:** [Specify your CI tools, e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins].
* **Execution:**
    * Automated tests are executed on every push and pull request.
    * Test results are reported in the CI pipeline.

## Testing Environment

* **Development:** Tests are run in a development environment.
* **Staging:** Integration and E2E tests are run in a staging environment that mirrors the production environment.
* **Production:** Manual smoke tests are performed after deployment to production.

## Reporting Bugs

* Use the project's issue tracker to report bugs.
* Provide detailed steps to reproduce the bug.
* Include screenshots or error messages when applicable.
* Specify the environment in which the bug occurred.
