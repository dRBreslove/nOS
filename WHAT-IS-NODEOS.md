# What is NodeOS?

NodeOS is a lightweight operating system built entirely on Node.js, leveraging the Linux kernel. It uses npm as its package manager, granting access to a vast library of packages. The primary goal of NodeOS is to provide just enough functionality to let npm handle the rest, making it highly modular and customizable.

## Key Features
- **Node.js-Based**: The entire userspace is built on Node.js.
- **Cross-Platform**: Runs on real hardware, virtual machines, cloud providers, and containers.
- **Package Management**: Uses npm, offering access to over 400,000 packages.
- **Multi-User Support**: Each user has an isolated environment with their own root filesystem.

## Use Cases
NodeOS is ideal for developers looking for a minimalistic, Node.js-centric operating system for experimentation, development, or deployment in lightweight environments.
